# Caesar-Cipher

## Project Description

The program is capable of encrypting and decrypting text in accordance with the Caesar algorithm.  
It asks the user for the following information:

- direction: encryption or decryption;
- alphabet language: Russian or English;
- shift step (shifted to the right).

**Notes:**  
1. Consider that the Russian language has 32 letters (the letter Ñ‘ is missing).
2. Non-alphabetic characters - punctuation marks, spaces, numbers - do not change.
3. Character case is preserved.
